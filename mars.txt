Cold and Dry. Found someone called Watney's poop everywhere. What a 
waste.

There are two moons, which may be an issue for the Wolf-Person-Thingy.

Also one of them is gonna crash into mars in a few million years so that 
might be a problem later on.

It's a tad cold and also hard to breathe. Maybe terraform? I dunno. Ask 
Elon, he has some plans doesn't he? Wait... Didn't he say something 
about nuking it. That's a bad idea.

Maybe just a really big space blanket to heat it up...

It's also littered with useless robots left by those stupid humans.
